# Homework #3

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Objects
	Everything in java script is an Object. An object contains pairs of properties and values where each property has a unique name. One can create as many objects as they need and assign them to variables. 
	* Properties
	Properties are the keys to different values in the object
	* Methods
	Methods are functions that may have zero or more arguments.
	* for in loop
	The for in loop iterates over the properties of an object, in order for each property, statements can be executed.
	* Dot notation vs bracket notation
	Dot notation is used to access a property of an object as a name where as bracket notation is used to access a property using a string. For example lets say there is an object o {name: "value"} the property name can be accessed as o.name in dot notation or o['name'] in bracket notation.

	* `git status`
